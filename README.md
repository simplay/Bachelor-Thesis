Description: Simulate the effect of diffraction (the far-field-effect) on a given surface for a given patch of the nanostructure of the surface.
Assumption: The patch is periodic all over the surface (at least piecewise). The simulation itself is rendered in realtime by a shader written in OpenGL accessed by a Java-Driver program using Jogl.
