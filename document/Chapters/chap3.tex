\section{Implementation}

how to discretize from final derivation to computation?
what do we have to precompute, what during runtime?
how does the final algorithm look like
explain shaders: vertex(geometriy, precomp) - and fragment-shader(in local space-tspace)
how from $cie_xyz$ to $cie_rgb$
how gamma correction
how texturing 
can we do better?
